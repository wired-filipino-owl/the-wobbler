# The Wobbler: Inspired by Sound Werkshop's "The Wiggler"

Project inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4khM5Bjihg

My senior project at Oregon Institute of Technology, CSET Department.

### Software build setup
Clone https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP/ and https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy/ into `$HOME/lib/Daisy/`.
I suggest using `git checkout` to get the versions that match the Daisy Examples repo, otherwise the code might not compile due to version mismatch.
Build is done via `make`. The demos are dependant on the libDaisy Makefile, so make sure to put libDaisy in the right place or be prepared to edit the Makefile with the correct path.
 

### Non-code artifacts
Schematics are in `/schem`

More to come soon!
